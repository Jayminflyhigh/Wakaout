## Security

## Background
This is a development version of Waka-out. Here we have built basic models with keras. We need lot's of images means data to feed that model. We created some programe where we can generate Nth images with background. Then for labelling we need to use an open source label tool called [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg). Later we can find better tool than this. Our main target is to build datasets for use YOLO Object Detection tool.
